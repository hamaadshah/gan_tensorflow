# Automatic feature engineering using Generative Adversarial Networks
We will explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks for automatic feature engineering. The idea is to automatically learn a set of features from, potentially noisy, raw data that can be useful in supervised learning tasks such as in computer vision.

### Python environment

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
